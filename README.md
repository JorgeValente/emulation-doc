Emulation - Retroarch Documentation

After getting tired to learn and having to re-read a lot of documentation everytime a new install was needed, I decided to write the documentation myself. Will try to follow a no BS straight to the point logic; also try to keep up with the releases & change of times.

# RetroArch

## Installation

Download & Install latest Version (In this case: 1.8.2 Win Installer x64).

Double Click install file and Accept all Dialogs (Default Install to : C:\Users\jorgi\AppData\Roaming\RetroArch\ ).

Run RetroArch to check installation was okay.

__Note:__ if RetroArch runs unstable with target ROM or ROM Core, try a different version; moving forward to Nigthies or backwards to older versions may work better.

## Install Cores

Go to Load Core > Download a Core and Select the ones to install

For Reference, these seem to work best for their platform:

- Arcade: MAME
- NEC PC Engine & TurboGrafx-CD: Beetle PCE (Mednafen)
- Nintendo DS: Desume
- Game Boy Advance: mGBA
- Nintendo GameCube: Dolphin
- NES: Nestopia
- N64: Mupen64 (performance), ParaLLEl (accuracy)
- SNES: Snes9X (Current)
- Sega Dreamcast: Flycast
- Sega Master System/Genesis/CD: Genesis Plus GX
- PS1: Beetle PSX HW

## Load Games

Load Games into Collections, ie per console platform.

From Main Menu: Import Content icon, select Scan Directory -> Parent Directory or Directories of ROMs.


## Controller Setup

Plug in the controller and check OS detects it properly or install any drivers necessary.

TODO : add further details from : Retroarch control setup

## Tweaks for Graphics & Sound

TODO : Graphics, Plugins and other tweaks & Shaders

## Launchbox extra frontend

Download Launchbox from: <https://www.launchbox-app.com/download> (Must register email for download, Latest version 10.7)

In Launchbox, Go to Tools > Manage Emulators > Add. In the 'Emulator Name' box, select Retroarch from the dropdown menu, then point the 'Emulator Application Path' box to the directory of Retroarch.exe.

Import games to Launchbox: Go to Tools -> Import -> Rom Files and follow the wizard.
